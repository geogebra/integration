into GeoGebra's input bar. Returns whether command evaluation was successful. From GeoGebra 3.2 you can pass multiple
commands at once by separating them with \n. Note: you must use English commands names
|boolean evalLaTex(String input)|5.0| Evaluates LaTeX string to a construction element. Basic syntaxes like `x^{2}` or `\frac` are supported.

|String evalCommandGetLabels(String cmdString) |5.0 |Like evalCommand(), but the return value is a String containing a
comma-separated list of the labels of the created objects eg `++"A,B,C"++`

|String evalCommandCAS(String string) |3.2 |Passes the string to GeoGebra's CAS and returns the result as a String.
|void insertEmbed(String type, String uri)|6.0 (Notes)| Inserts embedded element with specific type and URI.

== [#Event_listeners]#Event listeners#

With these methods you can implement Applet to JavaScript communication. For example, these methods can be used to:

* monitor user actions (see https://geogebra.github.io/integration/example-api-listeners.html[Event listeners example])
* communicate between two GeoGebra applets (see https://geogebra.github.io/integration/example-api-sync.html[two applets
example])

[width="100%",cols="34%,^33%,33%",options="header",]
|===
|Method Signature |Since |Description
|void registerAddListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as an add listener for the applet's construction. Whenever a new object is created in
the GeoGebraApplet's construction, the JavaScript function is called using the name of the newly created
object as its single argument.

Example: First, register a listening JavaScript function:

ggbApplet.registerAddListener(myAddListenerFunction);

When an object "A" is created, the GeoGebra Applet will call the Javascript function

myAddListenerFunction("A");

|void unregisterAddListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 |Removes a previously registered add listener, see
registerAddListener()

|void registerRemoveListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as a remove listener for the applet's construction. Whenever an object is deleted from
the GeoGebraApplet's construction, the JavaScript function is called using the name of the deleted object
as its single argument. Note: when a construction is cleared, remove is not called for every single object, see
registerClearListener().

Example: First, register a listening JavaScript function:

ggbApplet.registerRemoveListener(myRemoveListenerFunction);

When the object "A" is deleted, the GeoGebra Applet will call the Javascript function

myRemoveListenerFunction("A");

|void unregisterRemoveListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 |Removes a previously registered remove listener, see
registerRemoveListener()

|void registerUpdateListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as a update listener for the applet's construction. Whenever any object is updated in
the GeoGebraApplet's construction, the JavaScript function is called using the name of the updated object
as its single argument. Note: when you only want to listen for the updates of a single object use
registerObjectUpdateListener() instead.

Example: First, register a listening JavaScript function:

ggbApplet.registerUpdateListener(myUpdateListenerFunction);

When the object "A" is updated, the GeoGebra Applet will call the Javascript function

myUpdateListenerFunction("A");

|void unregisterUpdateListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 |Removes a previously registered update listener, see
registerUpdateListener()

|void registerClickListener(JSFunction function) |5.0 |Registers a JavaScript function as a click listener for the
applet's construction. Whenever any object is clicked in the GeoGebraApplet's construction, the JavaScript function
is called using the name of the updated object as its single argument. Note: when you only want to listen
for the updates of a single object use registerObjectClickListener() instead.

|void unregisterClickListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 |Removes a previously registered click listener, see
registerClickListener()

|void registerObjectUpdateListener(String objName, JSFunction function) |3.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as an update listener for a single object. Whenever the object with the given name is
updated, the JavaScript function is called using the name of the updated object as its single argument. If
objName previously had a mapping JavaScript function, the old value is replaced. Note: all object updated listeners are
unregistered when their object is removed or the construction is cleared, see registerRemoveListener() and
registerClearListener().

Example: First, register a listening JavaScript function:

ggbApplet.registerObjectUpdateListener("A", myAupdateListenerFunction);

Whenever the object A is updated, the GeoGebra Applet will call the Javascript function

myAupdateListenerFunction();

Note: an object update listener will still work after an object is renamed.

|void unregisterObjectUpdateListener(String objName) |3.0 |Removes a previously registered object update listener of the
object with the given name, see registerObjectUpdateListener()

|void registerObjectClickListener(String objName, JSFunction function) |5.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as a click listener for a single object. Whenever the object with the given name is
clicked, the JavaScript function is called using the name of the updated object as its single argument. If
objName previously had a mapping JavaScript function, the old value is replaced. Note: all object click listeners are
unregistered when their object is removed or the construction is cleared, see registerRemoveListener() and
registerClearListener().

Example: First, register a listening JavaScript function:

ggbApplet.registerObjectClickListener("A", myAclickListenerFunction);

Whenever the object A is clicked, the GeoGebra Applet will call the Javascript function

myAclickListenerFunction();

Note: an object click listener will still work after an object is renamed.

|void unregisterObjectClickListener(String objName) |5.0 |Removes a previously registered object click listener of the
object with the given name, see registerObjectClickListener()

|void registerRenameListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as a rename listener for the applet's construction. Whenever an object is renamed in the
GeoGebraApplet's construction, the JavaScript function is called using the old name and the new name of
the renamed object as its two arguments.

Example: First, register a listening JavaScript function:

ggbApplet.registerRenameListener(myRenameListenerFunction);

When an object "A" is renamed to "B", the GeoGebra Applet will call the Javascript function

myRenameListenerFunction("A", "B");

|void unregisterRenameListener(String objName) |3.0 |Removes a previously registered rename listener, see
registerRenameListener()

|void registerClearListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as a clear listener for the applet's construction. Whenever the construction in the
GeoGebraApplet is cleared (i.e. all objects are removed), the JavaScript function is called using no
arguments. Note: all update listeners are unregistered when a construction is cleared. See registerUpdateListener() and
registerRemoveListener().

Example: First, register a listening JavaScript function:

ggbApplet.registerClearListener(myClearListenerFunction);

When the construction is cleared (i.e. after reseting a construction or opening a new construction file), the GeoGebra
Applet will call the Javascript function

myClearListenerFunction();

|void unregisterClearListener(JSFunction function) |3.0 |Removes a previously registered clear listener, see
_registerClearListener()_

|void registerStoreUndoListener(JSFunction function) |4.4 |Registers a listener that is called (with no arguments)
every time an undo point is created.

|void unregisterStoreUndoListener(JSFunction function) |4.4 |Removes previously registered listener for storing undo
points, see registerStoreUndoListener

|void registerClientListener(JSFunction function) |5.0 a|
Registers a JavaScript function as a generic listener for the applet's construction. The listener receives events as
JSON objects of the form

`++{type: "setMode", target:"", argument: "2"}++` where `++target++` is the label of the construction element related to
the event (if applicable), `++argument++` provides additional information based on the event type (e.g. the mode number
for setMode event). Please refer to the list of client events below.

|void unregisterClientListener(JSFunction function) |5.0 |Removes previously registered client listener, see

== GeoGebra's File format

With these methods you can set everything in a construction (see xref:XML.adoc[XML Reference] ).

[cols=",^,",options="header",]
|===
|Method Signature |Since |Description
|void evalXML(String xmlString) |2.7 |Evaluates the given XML string and changes the current construction. Note: the
construction is NOT cleared before evaluating the XML string.

|void setXML(String xmlString) |2.7 |Evaluates the given XML string and changes the current construction. Note: the
construction is cleared before evaluating the XML string. This method could be used to load constructions.

|String getXML() |2.7 |Returns the current construction in GeoGebra's XML format. This method could be used to save
constructions.

|String getXML(String objName) |3.2 |Returns the GeoGebra XML string for the given object, i.e. only the <element> tag
is returned.

|String getAlgorithmXML(String objName) |3.2 |For a dependent GeoElement objName the XML string of the parent algorithm
and all its output objects is returned. For a free GeoElement objName "" is returned.

|String getFileJSON() |5.0 |Gets the current construction as JSON object including the XML and images

|String setFileJSON(Object content) |5.0 |Sets the current construction from a JSON (object or string) that includes XML
and images (try getFileJSON for the precise format)

|String getBase64() | |Gets the current construction as a base64-encoded .ggb file

|String getBase64(function callback) |4.2 |Gets the current construction as a base64-encoded .ggb file asynchronously,
passes as parameter to the callback function when ready. The callback function should take one parameter (the base64
string).

|void setBase64(String [, function callback] ) |4.0 |Sets the current construction from a base64-encoded .ggb file. If
callback function is specified, it is called after the file is loaded.

=== [#Obtaining_the_API_Object]#Obtaining the API Object#

If you are loading GeoGebra using the `++deployggb.js++` script, you can access the api as an argument of
`++appletOnLoad++`:

....
const ggb = new GGBApplet({
  appletOnLoad(ggbApi) {
    // ggbApi provides the applet API
  }
});
ggb.inject(document.body);
....

For compatibility reasons the API objects can be also accessed via global variables. The name of the global variable is
`++ggbApplet++` by default and can be overridden by the `++id++` parameter passed to `++new GGBApplet(...)++`. In case
you have multiple GeoGebra apps on a page, `++ggbApplet++` always contains API of the last active one. In such case you
should either avoid using global variables or use set the `++id++` parameter explicitly for all apps.

=== [#Obtaining_the_API_Object_as_a_module:_The_ES6_way]#Obtaining the API Object as a module: The ES6 way#

You can use math-apps module now to inject the applet the ES6 way too

....
<script type="module">
    import {mathApps} from 'https://www.geogebra.org/apps/web3d/web3d.nocache.mjs';
    mathApps.create({'width':'800', 'height':'600',
        'showAlgebraInput': 'true',
        'material_id':'MJWHp9en'})
        .inject(document.querySelector("#applet1"));
</script>
<div id="applet1"></div>
....

Example of using the API:

....
mathApps.create({'appName':'graphing'})
    .inject(document.querySelector("#plot"))
    .getAPI().then(api => api.evalCommand('f(x)=sin(x)'));
....
